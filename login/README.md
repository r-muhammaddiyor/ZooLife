## Features

- Toggle between login and registration forms with animated transitions.
- Clean, minimalistic design using the `Montserrat` font.
- Responsive layout optimized for various screen sizes.
- Styled input fields, buttons, and social icons for a seamless user experience.

## File Structure

- `index.php` or `index.html`: The main entry point of the application, containing the HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styling for the login/registration forms, animations, and overall layout.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for toggling between login and registration forms using button clicks.

## Usage

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file (e.g., `index.php` or `index.html`) includes the container for the login and registration forms, toggle panels, and social media icons.
2. **CSS Styling**: `style.css` defines the visual design, layout, and animations for transitioning between login and signup views.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: `script.js` handles the toggle functionality. When the user clicks the "register" or "login" buttons, the `container` class toggles between active and inactive states, switching views.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have a local server running (e.g., using XAMPP or another PHP environment).
3. Place the files in your server's public directory.
4. Access the `index.php` file via the server URL to view the login/registration interface.
5. The interface can also work with `index.html` in a standard browser, but `index.php` is required for XAMPP.

## Dependencies

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap): Used for typography.
- JavaScript should be enabled in the browser for the toggle functionality.
